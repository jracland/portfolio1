My first Web Portfolio built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript

I had just followed a code along video which taught the basics of HTML and CSS by building a sample portfolio. However, I didn't like the styling or the design and I wanted to further embed the learning into my memory, so I started the portfolio again from scratch but this time used google, w3schools and mozilla documentation, and stack overflow whenever I encountered difficulties. 

I built the templates of the pages and styled them with some images and CSS code. This stage was finished on 30/11/21.

Next, I will follow another codealong to learn Bootstrap, before coming back to this portfolio to finish styling it and making it responsive before adding the main content.
